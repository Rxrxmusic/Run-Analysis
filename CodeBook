run_analysis.R performs preparation through dataset downloading/extracting and then follows the 5 steps in the project's instructions:

1. Download dataset
  Saved in folder "UCI HAR Dataset"
  
2. Assign data to variables
  features <- features.txt
  the features are from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
  activities <- activity_labels.txt
  activities performed and their labels
  subjectTest <- test/subject_test.txt
  contains test data of 9/30 test subjects
  xTest <- test/x_test.txt
  contains recorded features test data
  yTest <- test/y_test.txt
  contains test data of activities’ labels
  subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt
  contains train data of 21/30 test subjects
  xTrain <- test/x_train.txt
  contains recorded features train data
  yTrain <- test/y_train.txt
  contains train data of activities’ labels

3. Merge training and test sets to make one data set
  X is made by merging xTrain and xTest using rbind()
  Y is made by merging yTrain and yTest using rbind()
  Subject is made by merging subjectTrain and subjectTest using rbind()
  Merged is made by merging Subject, Y, and X using cbind()

4. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  Tidy is made by subsetting Merged, selecting only columns subject and code, and of the measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
  
5. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  Numbers in code column of Tidy replaced with matching activity from activities variable

6. Appropriately label data set with descriptive variable names
  code column in Tidy renamed into activities
  Acc replaced by Accelerometer
  Gyro replaced by Gyroscope
  BodyBody replaced by Body
  Mag replaced by Magnitude
  starts with character f replaced by Frequency
  starts with character t replaced by Time

7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
  Final is made by sumarizing Tidy, taking the means of each variable after grouping by subject and activity.
  Export Final into Final.txt file.
